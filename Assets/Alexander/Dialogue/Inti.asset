  - "Well, this is an interesting place indeed\u2026"
  - Hello. Are you the owner of this shop?
  - "Many weary travelers stumble upon my shrine, scared, exhausted, alone\u2026"
  - And yet, just a few days ago, one recovered before me as if a miracle was brought
    upon him.
  - I'm not foolish. I can conjure up wonders, yes, but none to such extent.
  - What he did was drink a concoction fabricated by your hands.
  - The label. "Spelltacular Smoothies Menagerie". Clear as a sunny day.
  - Hmm? How do I know this? My, has humanity forsaken the essential ability to read?
  - But no matter. I would like an offering of one of your concoctions, if you may.
  - 'I seek no banal things such as strength or agility. '
  - Rather, what I wish for is new experiences. Yes, the true liberation of a wise
    soul.
  - 'I have never tried something sweet yet salty, if you would be so kind. I do
    hate sour flavors. '
  positiveMessage: I offer you my gratitude. May the sun shine brightly for you,
    always.
  negativeMessage: Was I mistaken? Is this not the wonderful menagerie I envisioned?
